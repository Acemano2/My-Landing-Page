<h1>The Undisputed Best Movies</h1>
<h2>The top Movie in each genre</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>The Lion King</h3>
<p>-This is Non-Arguably the most classic and raw forms of animation us 2006 kids grew up with.( I think it is coming of age huh)</p>

<h3>Bambi</h3>
<p>-This Movie Really hit hard as a kid. The way bambi had to take care afters its parent died. This was really the best thriller growing up.</p>

<h3>The Hunchank Of Notredame</h3>
<p>-Honestly i really felt for the man. Having that type of disability and having to live with it this movie really showed us the reality of the word. A perfect sad romance.</p>
